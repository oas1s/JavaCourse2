1. Checking for the correct email.
Write a regular expression that checks whether a string is a valid email address. Email must contain:
Latin letters, numbers, periods, hyphens and underscores up to the @ symbol.
After the @ symbol there must be a domain name containing only 3 letters and digits consisting of Latin letters and dots (for example, example.com).
